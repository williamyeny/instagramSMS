# InstagramSMS

An interface between Instagram and SMS. This allows you to receive Instagram notifications via SMS and reply to them accordingly using SMS. The Instagram API is not used; instead cookie-loading and GET/POST requests are the main technologies. The Twilio API handles the SMS aspect.

Please note: API keys in the commits have been revoked and only one Instagram account/phone number can be used per server instance. This should be used as an application with a web UI.
